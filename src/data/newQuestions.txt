Question 1:

You have been assigned to a new project, where the work is behind schedule and the team are not working together well. The team is relatively new, and conflicts are arising. Team members are blaming each other for work not done, and some people are not showing up to work on the project at all. What will you do next?

A. Meet with the functional manager to agree on the team members’ time requirement  
B. Meet with your team to set a team charter and define roles & responsibilities. ✅  

C. Meet with the project sponsor to gain additional funding for resources who can work together. ❌  

D. Escalate the issue to the steering committee as soon as possible as a project risk. ❌  

**Answer: B**  

The Standard for Project Management asks that we create a collaborative team environment, including team agreements, definitions of roles & responsibilities, formal committees tasked with specific objectives, and standing meetings that regularly review a given topic.

(PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p28, p29, “Create a Collaborative Team Environment”)*

Question 2:

You have recently completed a project for a new product and have been asked to manage it after its release to keep it relevant in today’s marketplace. Half of your existing project team are rolling off to other projects soon, and your project budget is nearly depleted. What will you do next?

A. Create a business case and project charter for your project sponsor to approve.  
B. Retain as many of your current project staff to continue work on the product.  
C. Raise a change request for your current project to add scope and continue making changes.  
D. Secure funding for a stable team, then use current research to form a suite of projects to improve the product.  

Answer: D  

This question is referring to product management. Product management involves the integration of people, data, processes, and business systems to develop or maintain a product or service throughout its lifecycle.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p17-19, “Product Management"

Question 3:

You are delivering a critical change and several key stakeholders in your organisation have added seemingly unnecessary steps for you to take, with extra approvals, reports and meetings. They are also restricting the people you need from working on your project in a larger capacity. What will you do next?

A. Go directly to the people you need to avoid extra back-and-forth with the stakeholders.  
B. Raise a risk in the risk register on the lack of access to sufficient resources.  
C. Communicate more often with the stakeholders and gain a deeper awareness of their ideas and situation.  
D. Show your stakeholders the Resource Assignment Matrix and project roles & responsibilities.  

Answer: C  

This question refers to the principle of Effectively Engaging with Stakeholders. Stakeholders may add steps or requirements, or restrict team members if not engaged appropriately. Communication and awareness of their ideas, through knowledge sharing and regular meetings (ideally face to face) help.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition 2021, p32, 33, "Effectively Engage with Stakeholders."

---

Question 4:

You are managing a project team mostly made up of men. Recently Jane was hired for her high expertise in the brands that make up your industry. You notice she has been left out of some key meetings, and others are overlooking her opinions. You also notice she is paid significantly less than her male colleagues. What will you do next?

A. Make steps to update her pay to the same range as the others on your project, and ask her opinion and advice specifically during each meeting (along with others in your team).  
B. Take the lower pay as a win for your project, as it will help keep costs low and her colleagues don’t need to know.  
C. Ask Jane to write down her knowledge of the industry, just in case she leaves.  
D. No need to rock the boat — this is just how people work in this industry.  

Answer: A  

This question is on Integrity and Stewardship. We should have respectful engagement of project team members, including their compensation, access to opportunity, and fair treatment.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p25, “Be a diligent, respectful and caring steward”.

---

Question 5:

During one of your working group meetings, a stakeholder raises the concern that the product you are working on will be discontinued in the next five months. You were not aware of this, and your project budget has already been approved until the scheduled delivery, which is in five months also. What will you do next?

A. Keep the project going as it is — the discontinued product isn’t your responsibility.  
B. Set a meeting with your project sponsor to share the information and a recommendation to terminate the project.  
C. Change the scope of the project to meet a different product so your project can remain relevant.  
D. Ask for additional funding to see if you can improve the product instead of discontinuing it.  

Answer: B  

This question is about delivering value — the primary motivator for a project. If the project is no longer aligned with the business need or it seems unlikely to provide value, the organisation may choose to terminate the effort.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p35, "Focus on Value"

---

Question 6:

You have collected the requirements for your project and are creating the scope statement and work breakdown structure. During this process, you notice some functionality in your database system that will help a different project you are aware of within your Project Management Office (PMO). What will you do next?

A. Place the feature in the other project’s backlog, and ask them to prioritise it as soon as possible.  
B. Raise the functionality in your risk register as a threat, with the response to “mitigate.”  
C. Add the scope to your project and complete it as soon as possible.  
D. Raise the functionality in your risk register as an opportunity with the response to “exploit,” and meet with the other project team and sponsor to discuss.  

Answer: D  

Systems thinking involves taking a holistic view of how project parts interact with each other and external systems. Projects operate within programs, and small systems affect larger ones. Finding a previously unknown opportunity, the next best step is to make it known and exploit the opportunity.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p39, "Respond to System Interactions: Systems Thinking" p125, "Oppurtunities"

---

Question 7:

You are working on a high-profile project. Several high-ranking senior executives want to take the credit for this initiative, while limiting the impact to their own resources. This has led to several conflicts and a scope statement that is unclear, leading to a risk of project failure. What will you do next?

A. Create a scope statement yourself to avoid further conflict.  
B. Facilitate a discussion with the executives as a neutral third party, focusing on agreed project goals.  
C. Limit your project resources to the executives until they can agree on a way forward.  
D. Escalate the issue to the project steering committee and ask them to resolve the problem.  

Answer: B  

Leadership is not the same as authority. When senior managers suffer conflict over priorities, neutral facilitation helps more than detailed recommendations. Leadership acumen involves focusing a team around agreed goals, generating consensus on the way forward, negotiating and resolving conflict, and more.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p42, "Demonstrate Leadership Behaviours"

---

Question 8:

You are managing a project where the majority of the product has been planned up-front, but an external system is needed from a vendor in partial pieces where the requirements are unclear. Half of your stakeholders want to use a waterfall approach, and the other half are advocating for an Agile approach. What will you do next?

A. Use an Agile methodology. The fixed scope is low risk, and you can capture changes using Agile.  
B. Use a Waterfall methodology and ask the team to plan the uncertain scope better.  
C. Proceed with a hybrid method to start, with pre-planned scope but Agile ceremonies that promote feedback.  
D. Use a combination of Waterfall and Agile to capture all the requirements and keep stakeholders happy.  

Answer: C  

Each project is unique, and success is based on adapting to the unique context of the project to determine the most appropriate methods. The tailoring approach is iterative in nature and refined during the project cycle. This project requires a hybrid of waterfall and agile, with the option to improve it over time.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p44-46, "Tailoring"

---

Question 9:

You are working on a project where senior users have been testing the product as parts are released. They have found some missing requirements and defects. Their manager is worried that the project won’t deliver a product that is fit for purpose, without defects and within the timeframe needed. What will you do next?

A. Perform some of the testing yourself to ensure a quality product.  
B. Help every team member to focus on quality, from correct acceptance criteria to a developed and tested product.  
C. Limit testing until the very end of the project so you can do it all in one go when the product is completely ready.  
D. Increase the testing on your project and add more testing resources so no defect goes unnoticed.  

Answer: B  

Quality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deliverables and satisfying stakeholders’ expectations on product requirements. Quality is everyone’s responsibility in an Adaptive (Agile) project.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p47-49, "Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables."

---

Question 10:

You are working through the risk assessment with your team, who are having trouble coming up with ideas for risks. You decide to give them some guidance on types of complexity that might affect your new product. What will you do next?

A. Ask them to brainstorm Qualitative and Quantitative risks.  
B. Ask them to perform the Five Whys and Ishikawa analysis.  
C. Ask them to brainstorm around possible unwanted human behaviour, system behaviour, ambiguity, and technical innovation impacts.  
D. Ask them to perform a retrospective to discover what isn’t working well, and what still puzzles us.  

Answer: C  

Complexity is often the result of human behaviour, system interactions, technical innovation, uncertainty, and ambiguity. Complexity can be introduced by events or conditions that affect value, scope, stakeholders, risk, and more.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p50, 51, "Navigate Complexity"

---

Question 11:

You are working on a project where you discover a certain negative risk with a potential impact of $2,000,000. You meet with your project stakeholders who determine that this is within their risk appetite, provided you meet a risk threshold of 10%. What will you do next?

A. Note the acceptable risk level as a threat of $200,000 (10%).  
B. Note the acceptable risk level as a threat of $1,800,000 to $2,200,000 (10% variance).  
C. Note the impact as outside the acceptable risk level of $2,000,000.  
D. Note the impact as an opportunity of $200,000 (10%).  

Answer: B  

Risk appetite describes the level of uncertainty or risk your stakeholders are willing to accept. Risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite. In this scenario, a 10% variation around $2m is $1.8m to $2.2m.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p54, "Risk"

---

Question 12:

A risk has been raised in your project around insufficient building materials. One risk response assigned to the functional manager suggests using a brand new material, which has not been fully tested in a building project. Half of your stakeholder group are happy with this risk response, but the other half are not and refuse to sign off on it. What will you do next?

A. Suggest a quantitative risk approach to give a more accurate financial impact.  
B. Suggest they proceed with the proposed risk response, and ensure it is followed through.  
C. Suggest a different risk owner, as an executive may have more power to respond to the risk.  
D. Suggest a different risk response, as they should be timely, cost-effective, realistic, and agreed to by relevant stakeholders.  

Answer: D  

This question refers to risk responses. Risk responses should be appropriate and timely to the significance of the risk, cost-effective, realistic within the project context, agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and owned by a responsible person. D is the best answer.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p54, "Risk"

---

Question 13:

Your project is starting to go off track due to a large amount of uncertainty in the requirements and resources. At a significant cost, you have managed to reign in these issues; however, your project management office would like you to brainstorm ways to improve with your team so that they do not happen again. What will you do next?

A. Ask your team to increase the project Contingency Reserve, to allow for these impacts.  
B. Ask your team to change the project methodology from Waterfall to Agile.  
C. Ask your team to use short feedback loops, continuous improvement, and transparent planning.  
D. Ask your team to check their work twice before sending it to the next part of the process.  

Answer: C  

A project team needs to embrace adaptability and resiliency with methods such as using short feedback loops, continuous learning and improvement, regular inspection and adaptation of project work, diverse project teams, transparent planning, using prototypes, and more.

(PMBOK Guide) - Seventh Edition, 2021, p56, "Embrace Adaptability and Resiliency."

---

Question 14:

As your project progresses, many of the business stakeholders are starting to voice their concerns, to question some of the changes, and even miss key meetings while trying to sabotage your efforts. What will you do next?

A. Communicate the vision and benefits for the change clearly, along with the impact to their work.  
B. Create an impact over influence chart to determine who should be engaged appropriately.  
C. Escalate the matter with your project sponsor, and arrange for different stakeholders.  
D. Map the current state and the proposed future state of the change for the stakeholders.  

Answer: A  

This question is on change management, which is a structured approach to transitioning groups to a future state. Too much change or lack of understanding can lead to resistance and change fatigue. Methods include communicating the vision, goals, and benefits of the change early, along with the impact to work processes.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p59, “Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state”.

---

Question 15:

You are analysing your stakeholder through an impact over influence chart and have found more than 100 different groups of people, and over 3000 impacted stakeholders. Other parts of your project are starting to fall behind as you try to keep up with the large amount of people. What will you do next?

A. Ask your project team to engage different groups of stakeholders so everyone is covered.  
B. Clearly prioritise the stakeholders then engage and communicate with the highly impacted and influential groups early and often.  
C. Monitor the stakeholders for signs of stress and respond to groups most stressed about the project.  
D. Create a SharePoint page for changes that any stakeholder can gather information from anytime.  

Answer: B  

This question is about engaging stakeholders. The process includes: Identify, Understand and Analyse, Prioritise, Engage and Monitor your stakeholders. Where you have too many to engage effectively, prioritisation is the key. Impact and influence are two ways, as well as Power, Beliefs, Expectations, proximity to the project, interest and more.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p11, 12, “Stakeholder Engagement: Prioritise and Engage”

---

Question 16:

You are managing a project which communicates to the customer using mostly pull communication so far. When monitoring the engagement of your stakeholders, you notice a trend that they are not clear on the impacts or benefits of the project. You decide to add push communication to your communication plan. What will you do next?

A. Create a webpage using SharePoint with all the project information, that your stakeholders can see.  
B. Push for more funding on your project, and communicate this to your project sponsor.  
C. Push your stakeholders to engage in more two-way communication.  
D. Send a weekly email to stakeholders with a project update, including the impacts and benefits.  

Answer: D  

Push communication is sent to stakeholders, using memos, emails, status reports, voice mail and more. Pull communication is something a customer can pull at any time — from a bulletin, a web page, a white board, etc.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p13, “Types of Communication”

---

Question 17:

You have taken over on a project with a vendor where scope and requirements have been missed. You notice that miscommunication and mixed messages are common. You set a meeting with your team and the vendor’s team. The meeting is extremely important to get right. What will you do next?

A. Speak slowly and clearly with the vendor’s team, at a louder volume if necessary.  
B. Confirm they hear your message, determine if they agree, and identify nuanced or unintended messages they may have received.  
C. Only communicate with the vendor in writing, so you have a trail of proof if anything goes wrong in the future.  
D. Prepare a claim for the mishandled scope of your project through your procurement team.  

Answer: B  

This question is asking about communication. With all forms of communication, quick feedback loops provide the information you need by confirming they heard the message, determining if they agree, and identifying any nuances or additions to the message they may have added or heard.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p13, “Stakeholder Engagement: Engage”

---

Question 18:

Your stakeholders seem to be engaged, however, there are frequent changes to scope and requirements, causing delays. Issues are often raised and result in multiple rounds of feedback. You are not sure who or what could be the cause. What will you do next?

A. Perform root cause analysis with your project team on the problem to brainstorm ideas.  
B. Raise a risk in the risk register for the project delay, and review responses with your team.  
C. Review the issue log, risk register, and change log for the most frequent requestors, then update your stakeholder engagement approach for those people.  
D. Ensure your project budget has enough contingency reserves to meet the multiple reviews and delays.  

Answer: C  

A significant number of changes or modifications to the project requirements or scope may indicate stakeholders are not engaged or aligned with the project objectives. A review of the project issue register or risk register can identify challenges associated with individual stakeholders.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p15, “Checking outcomes — Stakeholder Performance”

---

Question: 19:

You have been working on a project where the manager leads in a dictatorship style. Over time, the team have stopped making suggestions, sick days and mental health days have become more frequent, and the pace of work has slowed. The manager comes to you for help. You suggest a servant leadership style instead. What will they do next?

A. Serve the team as much as they can, ensuring their every need is met.  
B. Focus on obstacle removal, encouragement, and development opportunities.  
C. Ensure their team are serving other team members and helping each other succeed.  
D. Serve the team new ways to do the work and engage them through additional variety.  

Answer: B  

Servant leaders allow project teams to self-organise when possible, and increase levels of autonomy by passing appropriate decision-making opportunities to project team members. Servant leadership behaviours also include obstacle removal, being a diversion shield, and development opportunities.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p18, “Distributed management and leadership.”

---

Question 20:

You have been allocated to a new project team with members from different parts of the functional business area. It soon becomes clear that very few of them have worked on a project before. There is also a lot of miscommunication and re-work occurring amongst the team, which is starting to cause delays. What will you do next?

A. Set a daily stand-up with your team to ensure they update what they completed.  
B. Review the Resource Assignment Matrix with your team and ensure they are doing their job.  
C. Help the team set their vision and objectives, roles and responsibilities, and team operations.  
D. Send your team members on training in their roles to increase their capability.  

Answer: C  

When project teams form across different organisations, more work may be required up front to establish a “one-team” mindset, ensuring everyone understands how they contribute. Team development such as establishing a vision, clear roles & responsibilities, and a way of working are key.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p18, “Common aspects of Team Development"

---

Question 21:

You have collected the requirements for your project, matched them to project scope, and broken them down into smaller parts and the activities required. In doing this, you notice that the manager of the marketing department has added extra scope that is unrelated to your current project. What will you do next?

A. Start an open dialogue with the functional manager, raise the incorrect scope items and their impacts.  
B. Override the marketing manager’s decision on scope as you are the senior project manager.  
C. Raise a change request for the additional scope and let the Change Control Board decide.  
D. Place the additional scope into the product backlog for the product owner to prioritise it.  

Answer: A  

Without an open dialogue, you may not know if the scope was a mistake, previously approved, or any other reason for it being there. Positive discourse and courage are key aspects of a winning project team culture. Others include support, respect, celebrating success, and transparency.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p21, “Project Team Culture”

---

Question 22:

Your project team are protected by a union agreement. You notice that they don’t know how to use the product you are improving, are slow to respond, and regularly complain about the work. Your project sponsor has had enough and threatens to shut the project down if improvements can’t be made. What will you do next?

A. Set up a new project with different team members and transfer the project work to that team.  
B. Set a clear project purpose and vision and pair your team with the customer to show them how they are making a positive difference.  
C. Tell your project team that they will lose their jobs if they don’t improve the speed of their work.  
D. Create a project Gantt Chart schedule and burndown chart so the project work is transparent to all.  

Answer: B  

This question calls for leadership skills, where setting a vision and purpose and showing your team how they are making a difference can increase their intrinsic motivation. Transferring to another team in the same company may risk the same result, and threatening your team may embed their behaviour further.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p24,25, “Leadership Skills: Establishing a Vision; Motivation”

---

Question 23:

During a key scope meeting, an argument arises. The business manager accuses the technology manager of not delivering to their needs on past projects, and the technology manager accuses the business manager of changing requirements that impact the delivery schedule. The meeting is at risk, with the stakeholders being closed off to any further discussion. What will you do next?

A. Take the side of the technology manager, as scope that impacts delivery should be controlled.  
B. Take the side of the business manager, as we should always deliver to the customer’s specification.  
C. Facilitate to keep communication respectful, focus on the issue in the present and search for alternatives together.  
D. Ensure they both agree to the change control process to avoid disagreements in the future.  

Answer: C  

Not all conflict is negative. How conflict is handled can either lead to more conflict or to better decision-making and stronger solutions. The PMBOK Guide notes open and respectful communication, focusing on the issue not the person, the present not the past, and searching for alternatives together.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p29, “Conflict Management”

---

Question 24:

You are working on a project where the project team is completely distributed around the country in multiple sites, including working from home. Some of the project team members have not been able to contribute to the project, and there are concerns from the program that the project will fall behind. What will you do next?

A. Raise a request to the program to co-locate all your project team members as soon as possible.  
B. Proceed with daily stand-ups and working group meetings with any team members in your area.  
C. Set team leaders for each area around the country, to report back to you as the centralised project leader.  
D. Use technology to maintain ongoing contact with audio and video for meetings, with a team website to keep all project information available.  

Answer: D  

This question is on distributed project teams. To improve you can use audio and video capabilities for meetings, use technology (including messaging) for ongoing contact, build in time to get to know remote team members, and have an open project site for information.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p30, “Distributed project teams”.

---

Question 25:

You are initiating a project to a sales team where the process will change significantly, even though the outcome of a completed sale will remain the same. The functional manager is concerned about the change and any disruption it might bring. What will you do next?

A. Kick off the project with multiple deliveries to deliver small parts and reduce the change impact.  
B. Kick off the project work with a single delivery at the end of the project when the process change is complete.  
C. Kick off the project with continuous delivery in mind, to ensure fast value to the business.  
D. Kick off the project using periodic deliveries, delivering value as it is ready.  

Answer: B  

This question covers delivery cadence and their various benefits. A process re-engineering project may not have any deliveries until near the end of the project when the new process is rolled out and ready.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p34, “Delivery Cadence”

---

Question 26:

You are working on a project where the requirements are clear but the solution ideas are uncertain. The product owner and the technical experts can’t be sure which ideas will work in practice, and which ones won’t. The organisation cannot afford to get this project wrong, as they have previously made mistakes and customers are starting to leave. What will you do next?

A. Use an Incremental development approach for the project.  
B. Use an Iterative development approach for the project.  
C. Use a Predictive development approach for the project.  
D. Use a hybrid development approach for the project.  

Answer: B  

For development approaches, an iterative approach is used when you need to capture ideas that might change, while still delivered in one release. Incremental progressively delivers features (or increments), Predictive plans everything up-front, and hybrid is a combination of predictive and adaptive.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p37, “Development approaches.”  
Agile Practice Guide, 2017, p18, “Characteristics of project lifecycles.”

---

Question 27:

You are working on a new product for your organisation where the requirements are complex and are likely to change a few times as the project progresses. The organisation also needs usable parts of the product to be released as soon as possible to try and capture some of the market they are aiming for, away from their competitors. What will you do next?

A. Recommend an Iterative development approach.  
B. Recommend a Predictive development approach.  
C. Recommend an Adaptive development approach.  
D. Recommend a Hybrid development approach.  

Answer: C  

Adaptive approaches are useful when requirements are subject to uncertainty and change. A clear vision is established at the start of the project, and initial known requirements are refined or replaced in accordance with user feedback or unexpected events.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p38, “Adaptive approach”

---

Question 28:

A new project has been kicked off in your organisation due to a recent government inquiry into your industry, which found multiple processes with significant regulatory oversight that need to change. The inquiry ordering these changes has given you a due date of 10 months’ time before you start incurring penalties. What will you do next?

A. Proceed, with an Agile development approach to deliver change as quickly as possible.  
B. Proceed, with a Hybrid development approach to respond to changes while planning up front.  
C. Proceed, with a Predictive methodology to ensure quality control.  
D. Proceed, with an Iterative methodology to improve using feedback.  

Answer: C  

In considerations for selecting a development approach, environments that have significant regulatory oversight may need to use a predictive approach due to the required process, documentation and demonstration needs.  

(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p40, “Considerations for selecting a development approach.”

---

Question 29:

Question:  
Your organisation is moving to an Agile way of work. Your project team are strongly opposed to using Agile as they have been burned using iterations, when executives used the team velocity to try and force the team to work faster instead of keeping a sustainable pace. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Add extra resources to your team to deliver faster and avoid executives getting involved.  
B. Proceed with a predictive development approach, and deal with the consequences later.  
C. Ask your team to work with Agile, velocity and iterations despite their hesitations.  
D. Suggest the team uses flow-based scheduling, with a Kanban board for visual work.

Answer:  
D

Explanation:  
Kanban is one of the largest parts of Agile approaches, aside from other major parts such as Lean, XP and Scrum. A flow-based scheduling approach does not use sprints, lifecycles, or velocity but optimises deliveries based on resource capacity, and minimises waste such as context-switching and hand-offs.

PMBOK Reference:  
(PMBOK Guide) — Seventh Edition, 2021, p45, “Flow-based scheduling.”

---

Question 30:

Question:  
Your team have not worked on projects before, and don’t know about waterfall, agile, or any of the different models. You project may also have requirements that are certain or uncertain, with varying levels of risk, so are not sure which approach to use as you begin this new project. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Use Waterfall and plan everything up front, so the team have more stability.  
B. Use general phase definitions such as Feasibility, Design, Build, Test, Deploy and Close.  
C. Use Agile to ensure you can respond to change while your team’s capability increases.  
D. Don’t use any project approach – it doesn’t matter as long as the work is getting done.

Answer:  
B

Explanation:  
All projects will go through the general phases of Feasibility, Design, Build, Test, Deploy and Close. Waterfall projects will do these in sequence once, while Agile projects will do these multiple times, for each feature or increment. The underlying principle remains the same, so it is a good place to start.

PMBOK Reference:

Question 31:

Question:  
You are a project manager in an organization with a directive Project Management Office, and are currently in between projects. The PMO asks you to prepare for an upcoming project in the accounting area by meeting with the functional manager there. You have no team, no scope or requirements and no timeline as yet. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Ask the functional manager for their wish-list of improvements, so you can take these to your PMO.  
B. Create a project management plan so the project, scope, budget, and schedule are more clear.  
C. Create a small backlog of work and start your first sprint, then progressively update the backlog as the project progresses.  
D. Progressively elaborate the vision statement and project charter to define a coordinated approach.

Answer:  
D

Explanation:  
Before initiating a project of any sort, we start with a vision statement, project charter, or business case in order to identify a coordinated path to achieve the desired outcomes.

PMBOK Reference:

Question 32:

Question:  
You are working on a project where part of the project delivers a high value, high risk component. Another part of the project delivers a routine change to the system. Your project sponsor wants to gain the business value as quickly as possible, but your project team wants to start with the work they are familiar with first. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Prioritise the high risk items at the end of the project.  
B. Prioritise the high risk items at the start of the project.  
C. Use an incremental approach and deliver part of the routine and high risk work in each sprint.  
D. Plan out the work in detail and secure a scope baseline, with formal change controls to reduce uncertainty.

Answer:  
B

Explanation:  
This question refers to the concept of the last responsible moment. Work that is novel or risky can be prioritised at the start of the project to reduce uncertainty with the project scope before a large investment has been made. Routine work can be delayed until the cost of further delay would exceed the benefit.

Question 33:

Question:  
You are working on an agile project where the functional area you are delivering to only has a high-level idea of the system requirements they will need. The functional manager suggests a Work Breakdown Structure, however your team feels that is more for a predictive (waterfall) delivery approach. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Use and create a WBS anyway, as it is just a tool.  
B. Use rolling wave planning, and keep the work at a high level until you are ready to work on it, when you can plan in detail.  
C. Note the high-level themes or epics, decompose them into features, and again into user stories.  
D. Ask the functional area for more detailed requirements before the project begins.

Answer:  
C

Explanation:  
This question refers to "decomposition" or breaking down the work. We could use a WBS, or rolling wave planning, but for an incremental approach breaking down the work from epics to features to user stories is a form of decomposition that fits the delivery approach.

Question 34:

Question:  
You are at the beginning of planning a new project, and have researched and gathered the requirements from the area, broken them down into deliverables and activities, which you believe could take 26 weeks to deliver. The project sponsor is asking you for an estimate on how long the project will take. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. Tell the project sponsor 26 weeks.  
B. Tell the project sponsor that you will use an iterative approach, where value is delivered until the project stops.  
C. Tell the project sponsor approximately 24 to 28 weeks.  
D. Tell the project sponsor approximately 20 to 45 weeks.

Answer:  
D

Explanation:  
This question is related to estimation and range. Estimates should have a broad range at the start of the project, starting at -25% to +75% when there is not much information. Once the project team has a smooth delivery cadence and experience in the product, a smaller range such as -5% to +10% can be used. A 0% range is used when everything is known – and the product has been delivered.

Question 35:

Question:  
After gathering your project requirements, project scope, and breaking it down into activities, you need to estimate the project schedule with your team. After some analysis and discussion, your team come up with a range of 53 to 75 days assigned across all tasks. What will you do next?

Options:  
A. The estimate is high accuracy but low precision - ask the team to come back with a more precise estimate.  
B. The estimate is low accuracy but high precision - ensure the estimates become more accurate as the project unfolds.  
C. The estimate is in high confidence but low precision - proceed as is and adjust using an incremental approach.  
D. The estimate is in low confidence but high accuracy - allow the team to become more confident as the project unfolds.

Answer:  
B

Explanation:  
This question is on estimates and their accuracy. The lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range in values. Precision is different from accuracy, as it refers to the exactness of the estimate, for example "2 days" is more precise than "sometime this week".

Question 36:

You are working on a business case where you know that the industry is undergoing a significant change at the moment, and there could be many different impacts to your project benefits before it is delivered completely. The project sponsor asks you for the best estimate of benefits you can give under the circumstances. What will you do next?

A. Ask your team for a probabilistic estimate.  
B. Ask your team for a deterministic estimate.  
C. Ask your team for an absolute estimate.  
D. Ask your team for a relative estimate.  

Answer: A

Probabilistic estimates include a range of estimates, along with the associated probabilities within the range such as a confidence level or a probability distribution. If the estimate is uncertain, this is the best approach. Deterministic is a number, absolute is specific, actual numbers and relative estimates are shown in comparison to other estimates.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p57, “Presenting estimates.”

Question 37:

You have noted nine epics for delivery as part of your most recent project. Your team have broken down these epics into user stories, and would like to see the effort involved for these deliverables. You ask your team to find the smallest user story, size it with a “1,” and then determine the size of the other cards based on how they compare to the original card. What approach are you taking?

A. Relative estimating with your team.  
B. Deterministic estimating to determine the effort.  
C. Absolute estimating to get an estimate with absolute certainty.  
D. Probabilistic estimating with the highest probability items.  

Answer: A

This question is about estimating, and making an estimate in comparison to other estimates is relative estimating.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p57, “Relative Estimating”

Question 38:

You are working on a project where a competitor is also working on a similar feature, and being first to the market will have a significant impact on this year’s profit. Your product owner would like to measure how quickly story cards are being completed, once they start being developed. What will you do next?

A. Check the Lead time of the story cards.  
B. Check the Gantt chart with assigned schedule activities.  
C. Check the Cycle time of the story cards.  
D. Check the schedule network and precedence diagram.  

Answer: C

Cycle time is the total elapsed time it takes one unit to get through a process. Lead time is the time from when the customer makes the order (or the requirement is noted) to the time the item is delivered or released. Schedule network diagram is useful for finding the Critical Path, and precedence diagramming is used to find what deliverable or activity relies on others.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p58, “Flow-based estimating”

Question 39:

You are working on a project that has recently moved to a more agile way of work. The team have not completely taken on the Scrum approach however, and are comfortable working with a more flow-based approach moving user stories across a Kanban board. You are wanting to get an estimate on how much work can be completed in the next three months, based on the team’s existing progress. What will you do next?

A. Multiply the velocity by the number of remaining user stories.  
B. Multiply the cycle time by the throughput.  
C. Multiply the lead time by the schedule performance index.  
D. Multiply the planned value by the actual value.  

Answer: B

Scrum uses velocity – Kanban or Flow-based estimates are developed by determining the cycle time and throughput. Cycle time is the total elapsed time it takes one unit to get through a process. Throughput is the number of items that can complete a process in a given amount of time.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p58, “Flow-based estimating.”

Question 40:

Your product owner wants to bring the next feature forward so that it is done in parallel to the current feature, but is still released in the existing feature order. You make the necessary adjustments to the product backlog, and decide to adjust the product roadmap, which you have visualized as a Gantt chart. What will you do next?

A. Use a schedule lead on the feature, and change the feature to finish-to-start  
B. Use a schedule lag on the feature, and change the feature to start-to-start  
C. Use a schedule lead on the feature, and change the feature to finish-to-finish  
D. Use a schedule lag on the feature, and change the feature to start-to-finish  

Answer: C  

A schedule lag is moving an item back, a schedule lead is bringing an item forward. Precedence diagramming method states for Finish-to-Finish items, the next item cannot finish until the previous item has finished. This allows the items to be worked on in parallel, while still keeping the same delivery order.

Question 41:

You are working on a project where you have been completing the deliverables in sequence, and the project work is starting to fall behind. The project sponsor asks you to speed up the work and reduce the time for the project to be delivered, but also makes it very clear that there is no more money to use when speeding up the work. What will you do next?

A. Apply leads and lags to your project schedule.  
B. Apply fast tracking to your project schedule.  
C. Apply schedule crashing to your project.  
D. Apply resource leveling to your project.  

Answer: B  

Project fast tracking is a schedule compression method in which activities or tasks that are normally done in sequence are performed in parallel. Schedule crashing includes adding people to activities, working overtime, or paying to expedite deliveries.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p59, “Schedules; Fast tracking, crashing.”

---

Question 42:

After reviewing your project schedule you notice you are behind by three weeks and the schedule will need to be compressed. Your project does not have enough budget to crash the schedule. You check with the lead for each area and review the schedule as to whether they can fast track their deliverables. What will you do next?

A. Fast track team items with discretionary dependencies.  
B. Fast track team items with mandatory dependencies.  
C. Fast track team items with external dependencies.  
D. Fast track team items based on industry regulation.  

Answer: A  

When compressing the schedule, some activities cannot be fast-tracked because of the nature of the work, others can. A discretionary dependency is based on project preferences, and may be modifiable. External and mandatory dependencies usually cannot be modified. Internal dependencies may be modifiable, except when based on specific regulatory needs.

Question 43:

Your team are new to agile, and had previously been working with Waterfall. Your key customer asks you for a project schedule. The project team believes using a project schedule is from the old waterfall way of working and they shouldn't have to create one. What will you do next?

A. Create a project Gantt chart to visualise the activities within the project.  
B. Determine the project’s planned versus actual value, instead of working with a schedule directly.  
C. Advise the customer that we don’t need to plan ahead in an adaptive way of work.  
D. Ask your team to develop a high level release plan like a product roadmap, showing the features to be included in each release.  

Answer: D  

Adaptive schedule planning uses incremental planning. A high level release plan is developed that indicates basic features and functionality to be included in each release.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p61, “Adaptive schedule planning.”

---

Question 44:

You are working in a project team that has recently moved to an Agile way of work. Your business analysts want to gather the requirements, solutions, match them to the scope and do a WBS for the whole deliverable. Your product owner says this will take too long, and is not agile enough for their needs. What will you do next?

A. Ask your team to review the scope management plan for the proper process.  
B. Break the deliverable down into smaller pieces so you can deliver those faster.  
C. Ask your team to timebox work on the highest priority items in the backlog, update the estimates then reprioritise as necessary.  
D. Review the project charter for the high level scope, and use this to begin delivery quickly.  

Answer: C  

Adaptive approaches often use timeboxes. The work is based on a prioritised backlog. The project team determines the amount of work they can do in each timebox, estimates the work and self-manages to accomplish the work. At this point, the backlog may be reprioritised for the next timebox.

Question 45:

When reviewing the current progress with your project sponsor, they notice that the system solution is missing a critical piece that will impact the benefit of the project. The project sponsor approves this scope. Your project has a Planned Value of $520,000 and an Actual Cost of $535,000. What will you do next?

A. Work with the PMO to unlock the project management reserves for the extra work.  
B. Ask the Product Owner to reprioritise the backlog and see if the new work will fit.  
C. Perform the work within your normal budget as your project is on track.  
D. Raise a change request for the changes and gain approval from the Change Control Board.  

Answer: A  

Management reserves are set aside for unexpected activities related to in-scope work. Depending on the organisation’s policies, management reserves may be managed by the PMO at the program or portfolio level.

Question 46:

You are in the planning stages of an Agile project where the functional manager and senior users have provided the high-level requirements and scope. You have been asked to put together a project team that will be able to deliver quickly. What will you do next?

A. Select project members from each city to ensure diversity of knowledge within the team.  
B. Put together a resource management plan outlining the resources required.  
C. Ask your PMO for current available resources and assign them to the work.  
D. Select a small team that can work in the same area so they can solve problems as they arise.  

Answer: D  

When planning for the team, the project manager considers the ability and necessity for them to work in the same location. Small project teams that can work in the same room are able to take advantage of osmotic communication and can solve problems as they arise.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p64, “Project Team Composition and Structure”

Question 47:

You are putting together a project team to deliver an accounting system to offices around the country. The accounting system you are moving to has not been used by anyone in your organization before. The project is quite high risk, and the delivery needs to be right the first time. What will you do next?

A. Select a small team that can work in the same area so they can solve problems as they arise.  
B. Use a predictive project approach and source part of your team externally if they have skillsets in the new system.  
C. Train existing internal staff in the new system then have them work on the project.  
D. Perform a make or buy analysis on the different software options.  

Answer: B  

The benefit that outside skills bring to the project are weighed against the costs that will be incurred. With higher risk and a single delivery, a waterfall or predictive project delivery approach is best.

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p63, “Project Team Composition and Structure”

Question 48:

You are putting together a project plan for a change that affects nearly ten thousand stakeholders in your organization. You have identified the affected stakeholders, analyzed and prioritized them, and are putting together a communication plan to ensure the right engagement is made. What will you NOT include in your plan?

A. Why should information be shared with stakeholders?  
B. What is the best way to provide information?  
C. How can they make changes to the communication plan?  
D. When and how often is information needed?  

Answer: C  

Planning communication for the project entails considering the following: Who needs information? Who has the information needed? Why should information be shared with stakeholders? When and how often is information needed? What is the best way to provide information? What information does each stakeholder need?  

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p64, “Communication”

Question 49:

You put together a resource plan for a large amount of physical inventory to be purchased from overseas. You ordered the inventory during project execution, however global supply chains were impacted and the shipment was delayed by three months, significantly impacting your project. What should you have done differently?

A. Hired a resource manager to take care of the resource tasks on your project.  
B. Planned strategically about the timing from order to delivery to usage, managing resource risks and their responses.  
C. Ensured a means to track the inventory from arrival on site to the delivery of an integrated product.  
D. Sourced the inventory locally to reduce the impact of global supply chains.  

Answer: B  

Project teams whose projects require significant physical materials think and plan strategically about the timing from order, to delivery, to usage. This can include evaluation of bulk ordering versus the cost of storage, global logistics and more.  

PMBOK Guide – Seventh Edition, 2021, p65, “Physical resources”

Question 50:

You are halfway through your agile project when there is a significant change to the project scope, after it was found that the project would not be able to deliver the benefits it had promised. You check your project budget and there are contingency and management reserves available. What will you do next?

A. Take the project scope change to the change control board for approval.  
B. Use the available contingency reserves to make the appropriate change to project scope.  
C. Review the change management plan for the change control process.  
D. Reprioritise the product backlog, including the new scope and begin work on the highest priority straight away.  

Answer: D  

Changes may occur as a result of a risk event, environment change, a deeper understanding of requirements, customer requests and more. Project teams should prepare a process for adapting plans throughout the project. In an Agile team, this may take the form of reprioritising the backlog instead of a change control process with project baselines.
