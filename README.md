# BACKLOG

1. *"As someone studying for the PMP exam, I want quizzes that focus on one or more exam domains."*
Work on some sort of randomization of questions
  - "People" only questions
  - "Process" only questions
  - "Business Environment" only questions
  - "Random Quiz" - develop logic

2. *"As a new frontend dev, I want to simulate a real world Aglie project as possible."*
Bring up UX/UI in parallel with code base/functionality
  - Settle on UX/UI solution and style
  - Write code! (with help)
3. Refactor as I go (technical debt mitigation) since I have the luxury of no business requirements or bosses breathing down my neck
4. Learn how to refactor

*"As someone studying for the PMP exam, I want to be able to track my progress and how I improve over time."*
5. Scorekeeping functionality - leaderboard???
6. Instant feedback on questions
