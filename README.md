  - "People" only questions
  - "Process" only questions

3. Bring up UX/UI in parallel with code base/functionality
  - Settle on UX/UI solution and style
  - Write code! (with help)
4. Refactor as I go (technical debt mitigation) since I have the luxury of no business requirements or bosses breathing down my neck
5. Learn how to refactor
6. Scorekeeping functionality - leaderboard???
